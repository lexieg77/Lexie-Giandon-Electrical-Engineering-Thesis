This repo includes the following:
* Mapping 20 failures to their corresponding spare parts using FAISS, key-value pairs, unsupervised clustering and supervised classification.
* Generating a critical spare parts list for 10, 50 and 500 samples spare parts from the 998K XE front-end loader
* Calculate the F1 scores between the critical spare parts list generated by the LLM and the original list produced by the NQHRM
